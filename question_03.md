In CSS, vw and vh are units of measurement that represent a percentage of the viewport's width and height, respectively. Here's what each unit stands for:

01. 'vw' (viewport width): 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1vw would be equal to 10 pixels (1% of 1000 pixels).

02. 'vh' (viewport height): 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. For instance, if the viewport height is 800 pixels, 1vh would be equal to 8 pixels (1% of 800 pixels).

Using 'vw' and 'vh' units allows you to create responsive designs that scale relative to the size of the viewport. These units are particularly useful for creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and maintain consistent proportions.

`.container {
  width: 50vw;   /* Set the width of the container to 50% of the viewport width */
  height: 75vh;  /* Set the height of the container to 75% of the viewport height */
  background-color: lightblue;
}`

In this example, the '.container' element will have a width equal to 50% of the viewport width and a height equal to 75% of the viewport height. This ensures that the container will adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining the specified proportions.

Using 'vw' and 'vh' units can be beneficial when designing responsive layouts, as they help create fluid and adaptable designs that respond well to various screen sizes and devices.
