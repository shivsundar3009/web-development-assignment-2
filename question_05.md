In CSS, the box-sizing property is used to control how the width and height of an element are calculated. It has two possible values: content-box and border-box. Here's how they differ:

01. Content-box (default behavior):

    When the box-sizing property is set to content-box, the width and height of an element are calculated based on its content area only.

    The specified width and height values do not include the padding or border of the element.

    The padding and border are added to the specified width and height, resulting in the total size of the element on the page.

    This means that if you set a width of 200px for an element, the final size of the element will be 200px plus any additional width from padding and border.

02. Border-box:

    When the box-sizing property is set to border-box, the width and height of an element are calculated by including the padding and border within the specified width and height.

    The specified width and height values directly represent the total size of the element, including its content area, padding, and border.

    This means that if you set a width of 200px for an element with padding and border, the element will be exactly 200px in total size, including the content, padding, and border.
     
The key difference between content-box and border-box lies in how the width and height of an element are interpreted and calculated. Content-box calculates the dimensions based on the content area only, while border-box includes the padding and border in the specified dimensions.

'
.element {
  box-sizing: content-box; /* or border-box */
}
'

The choice between content-box and border-box depends on your specific needs. border-box can be particularly useful in responsive designs or when dealing with complex layouts, as it simplifies the calculations and ensures that the element size remains consistent regardless of padding and border values.
